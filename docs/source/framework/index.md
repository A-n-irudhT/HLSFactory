# Framework Overview

The framework overview details all the core components of HLSFactory.

This section is designed to be a detailed guide to the components of HLSFactory, including short code examples. It is recommended for all users who want to use HLSFactory, but it is especially useful for power users. Power users will mainly leverage the extensible features of HLSFactory to run custom experiments, load custom designs, define custom flows, and utilize other custom features for their applications.

For more guided tutorials and demos, please refer to the [](../tutorials/index) part of the documentation.

<!-- ## Overview Diagram

Below is a diagram of all the core components of HLSFactory laid out to show the flow of designs and generated data as they are processed by the framework as well as where users can add their own designs, data, and configurations.
